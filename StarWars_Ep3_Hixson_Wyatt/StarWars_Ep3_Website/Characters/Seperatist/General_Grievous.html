            <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
            <p>General Grievous was a cyborg and the Supreme Commander of the Separatist Alliance military during the Clone Wars. 
                Originally a warrior named Qymaen jai Sheelal, he was severely injured in a shuttle crash and was rebuilt by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious 
                as a cybernetic being. Grievous was known for his fearsome combat abilities, particularly his mastery of lightsabers, which he collected 
                from fallen Jedi. His ruthless tactics and skill made him a formidable foe in battle. Despite his mechanical body, Grievous retained 
                a deep hatred for the Jedi Order and served as one of their greatest enemies.</p>
